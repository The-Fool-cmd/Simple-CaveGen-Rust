# Simple-CaveGen-Rust
## Description
A little TUI 'toy' to play around with random generation algorithms visually. You can apply them sequentially, pause and run them one step at time. The viewport isn't fixed so the terminal size/zoom does not break the visualisation. You can move the viewport using the cursor (hard-follow).
## Algorithms implemented
### Paint
<1> switches to the paint tool which you can use to change the current state of the grid
### Game of Life
<2> switches to the game of life algorithm
